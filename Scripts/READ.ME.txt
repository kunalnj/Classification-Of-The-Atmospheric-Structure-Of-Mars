Testing clustering on optical ratios: clustering_test_optical_ratio.ipynb
Overview of DTW: DTW.ipynb
Best attempy at classification: curve_length_knn.ipynb [Not well put but hopefully understandable]
Trying LSTM neural networks for mutilabel classification: LSTM.ipynb

Manually made labels under the label tag of .txt files

A lot of iPython notebooks which are hopefully understandable after going through clustering.py

Included the poster produced.

Was an amazing experience working on this project and cannot thank the ExoMars team enough.
Especially Graham Sellers (spelt it right this time!), Jon Mason and Manish Patel. Thank you!
