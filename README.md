# Classification Of The Atmospheric Structure Of Mars Using DBSCAN and DTW Clustering

The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter is a European Space Agency mission developed in collaboration with Roscosmos, to investigate the presence of trace gases in the Martian atmosphere. One of the on board instruments is the NOMAD (Nadir and Occultation for MArs Discovery) spectrometer, whose UVIS (Ultraviolet and VISible) [1] channel was used in this study, to classify the occultation transmission profiles produced by the attenuation of sun light observed through the Martian atmosphere, as measured by the detector. A pair of supervised and unsupervised algorithms were used to classify and cluster similar profiles, which are explained below. The process of classifying and clustering profiles allows the grouping of these profiles into categories, where each group could be representative of the type of atmospheric feature producing them.
